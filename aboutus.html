        <p>Felicity, a word synonymous with bliss, euphoria and happiness means
        so much more to us, IIITians. The three days of the festival bring with
        themselves, a wave of vitalizing energy, enthusiasm and celebration,
        the reverberations of which are felt throughout the campus.</p>


        <p>We at IIIT, believe in celebrating freedom, revelling in the joys of
        youth and showcasing our gratitude towards independence of mind and
        soul. Felicity, as it stands today is a conglomeration of all these
        cherished beliefs and ideas.</p>

        <p>The villages of India have always been the keepers of its cultural
        vitality. They safeguard the rich treasure of Indian heritage. From the
        daintiness of multi-hued bangles to the robustness of the Indian
        turban, from the silkiness of the tassels to the sharpness of the
        spices and from the orange of the saffron to the crimson and gold of
        the veils: all come together and to life in the Vibrant Villages of
        India.</p>


        <p>With the soaring grandeur of a palace, India has many such vibrant
        corridors and passageways which crave their countless stories be told
        and retold. This year let us embark on a journey through these
        forgotten passageways to discover the tales of our identities and
        origins.</p>
